This visually structured layout highlights common UI/UX pitfalls with a modern card-based design. Open-source and customizable for learning and design improvements.

I've created a modern, minimalist card grid design that displays all 12 UI/UX mistakes in a card layout. The design features::

`Key Design Elements:`

1. Large, Faded Numbers: Each card has an oversized, faded number in the background that creates visual interest and makes it easy to identify each mistake at a glance.
Clean, Minimalist Layout:

2. White cards against a subtle gradient background
* Soft shadows for depth.
* Rounded corners for a modern feel.
* Ample white space for readability.

3. Interactive Elements:

* Subtle hover effects that lift the cards and enhance the background number.
* Cursor change to indicate interactivity.


4. Typography Hierarchy:

* Bold headings for the mistake titles.
* Different font weights to establish visual hierarchy.
* Adequate spacing for optimal readability.

5. Responsive Design:

The grid adapts to different screen sizes
* 3-column layout on large screens.
* 2-column layout on medium screens.
* Single column on mobile devices.


6. Colorful Card Accents:

* Each card now has a distinctive colored top border (5px)
* The large background numbers match each card's accent color
* Each mistake has its own unique color from a vibrant palette


7. Gradient Header:

* The header now has a bold blue gradient background
* Added a vibrant yellow accent for the "UI/UX" text
* White text for better contrast against the colored background

8. Enhanced Interactions:

* Hover effects still lift the cards.
* The colored numbers become slightly more vivid on hover.

The design maintains its clean, minimalist approach while the color accents add visual interest and help distinguish between the different UI/UX mistakes. Each card now has its own identity through color, making the entire presentation more engaging and memorable.

The color implementation is subtle enough to enhance readability rather than distract from it, with the white card backgrounds ensuring the content remains the focus.

The design successfully uses the JavaScript object dynamically generate all 12 cards, displaying just the number and title. The large, faded numbers in the background create visual interest while allowing users to quickly identify each mistake.
